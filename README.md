**Project Title:** JokesAPI

**Description:**
Developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to manage a collection of jokes. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations on jokes, including retrieving a random joke, filtering jokes by type, adding new jokes, updating existing jokes, and deleting jokes. Implemented authorization logic to restrict certain operations using a master key. Utilized bodyParser middleware for parsing request bodies and implemented error handling for robustness. The project showcases proficiency in backend development, API design, and RESTful principles.

- Node.js
- Express.js
- RESTful API Design
- CRUD Operations
