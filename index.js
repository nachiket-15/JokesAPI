//1. GET a random joke

// app.get() request comes from express js 
// then we add route -> /random
// Then we have callback (req,res)={}
app.get("/random",(req,res)=>{
  const randomIndex=Math.floor(Math.random()*jokes.length);
  res.json(jokes[randomIndex]);
});



//2. GET a specific joke

// Set up a route handler for HTTP Get Request with '/jokes/:id' as endpoint 
// :id is route parameter which represents ID of the Joke to be reterieved 
app.get("/jokes/:id",(req,res)=>{
  // Extract the id from request parameter & then parse it into an integer
  const id=parseInt(req.params.id);
  // Find the joke with specified ID in the 'jokes' array 
  const foundJoke= jokes.find( (joke)=> joke.id === id);//(basically it loops every object (here obj named as joke) while looping checks for a condition and thats why joke.id ,breaks when true and stores joke obj in foundJoke)
  // Send the found joke as JSON responce
  res.json(foundJoke);
});




//3. GET a jokes by filtering on the joke type

// Route handler for filter endpoint using GET request which filters joke based on their types
app.get("/filter",(req,res)=>{
  // Extract the value of "type" query parameter from the request
  const type=req.query.type;
  // Filter jokes based on the specified type
  const filteredActivities=jokes.filter((joke)=>joke.jokeType===type); //returns all objects where condition is true
  
  // Send the filtered jokes as JSON responce
  res.json(filteredActivities);
});

// filter() method of array in JS creates a shallow copy of portion of given array , filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass test implemented



//4. POST a new joke


// HTTP Post request with /jokes as endpoint to add new joke to collection of jokes 
app.post("/jokes",(req,res)=>{
  // Create a new joke object with 3 properties 
  const newJoke={
    // Generate a new id for new joke

  jokes.push(newJoke);
  // Output the newly added joke to console
  console.log(jokes.slice(-1));
  // Send the new joke as JSON repsonce
  res.json(newJoke);
});





//5. PUT a joke

// PUT request is a complete update , you have to provide all of the parts that are not automated into object.

  res.json(replacementJoke);

})

// findIndex() method of an Array returns index of first element in an array that satisfies providing testing condition.If nothing satisfies then -1 is returned



//6. PATCH a joke

// Little update to a complete request , not an entire update
// Lets change the joke type to Agriculture

app.patch("/jokes/:id", (req, res) => {
  // Extract the joke ID from the request parameters and parse it into an integer
  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);

  // Replace the existing joke with the updated joke
  jokes[searchIndex] = replacementJoke;
  
  // Output the updated joke to the console
  console.log(jokes[searchIndex]);


  res.json(replacementJoke); 

});

//a specific joke out of the array? Can you think of a solution?
app.delete("/jokes/:id", (req, res) => {

  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
